This is a easy way to start your docker life and to use anything in docker-compose by yourself.

First of all,you need to have a Linux system,if you don't have,you can install one of virtualbox(https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or vmware(https://www.vmware.com/tw/products/workstation-pro.html)

After you have a Virtual machine for Linux system,let's get started with docker!
First,choose your type of Linux system on official page(https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and follow it's steps,and the most difficult thing is building a 'docker-compose.yml' to use every tools you want on your virtual machine.
